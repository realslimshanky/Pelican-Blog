#### The Idea

[Rajat Saini](http://rajatsaini.com) who is one of the PyDelhi volunteers for a long time suggested [new concepts](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/ncr-python.in/2018-April/001759.html) for PyDelhi events on the mailing list. Discussions began both on the mailing list and on telegram volunteer group about the same and we planned to organize PyDelhi Dev Sprint on April 28th. Begin one of the volunteers I had the responsibility of creating a form for organizations and mentors, reaching out to them and also broadcast the news to different FOSS communities in and around Delhi.

[Knowlarity](https://www.knowlarity.com) invited PyDelhi to host Dev Sprint in their Gurugram office and also sponsored lunch afterward. It all began with a quick introduction from everyone and Sanyam taking a session on what Dev Sprints actually are. Later, the attendees chose their projects and circled around the mentors for the same. Those who were new to Git and Github were helped by [Priyank](https://twitter.com/priyankt68) who took the initiative of teaching VCS. Afterward, Knowlarity CTO, [Ajay Shrivastava](https://twitter.com/ajayshr) took a quick inspirational session and then Hiring and Pitching session took place.
